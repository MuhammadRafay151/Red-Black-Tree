Project Description
==============
The project is about the tree data structure and the tree is red black tree. Red black tree is also a binary search tree. Red black trees are self-balancing while BST is unbalanced. Red black tree performs operations like insertion, deletion and search in O(LOGN). So insertion and deletion is much faster than BST. The project contains operation (Public Methods) to insert values, delete values, search values, calculate size of tree, calculate height of trees. There are some private methods which are used in internal working of red black tree for balancing purpose of tree. 

Technology 
=======================

* The project was built using Visual studio 2017.
* Programming Language c＃
* .Net Frame Work 4.5.2  

How to run this project?
=======
